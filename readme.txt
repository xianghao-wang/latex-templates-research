Feel free to use it! I do not want it to be re-shared, i.e., you cannot publicly
make it available (other than a link to my repository), but you may use it for the
intended purpose, i.e., for your theses, reports, presentations, lecture slides, or posters.

Also note that whereas these templates clearly have been created for my purposes
at the ANU, they can of course easily be adjusted for other Universities.

Should you find any error anywhere please reach out to me!


(The file AmnestyInternational.sty is used by the presentation as well as the lecture
slide templates, which is why you find it in a common subfolder.)
