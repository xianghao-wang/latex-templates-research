  \caption{A caption for the illustrated graphic \citep{pictureSource}. It's made long on purpose so that you can see that it simply doesn't look good that the caption is below -- since there is now a lot a free/unused space. It would have been a better choice to place the caption next to it, which you can see in Figure~\ref{fig:graphicCaptionAside}.\label{fig:graphicCaptionBelow}}

  {\caption{Captions should not explain/interpret graphics, but enable the reader to read it. Further interpretations and conclusions should be in the text only. For this graphic the following caption might be appropriate: ``Motivational expressions written and pinned on a wooden fence~\citep{pictureSource}.''\ \\[1em]

  Also note how in this case the caption should be on the left (and not below the graphic as in Figure~\ref{fig:graphicCaptionBelow}) as otherwise there would be a lot of free/unused space. The code for this is a bit more complicated, but now you can simply change it, so it should be fine... :) \label{fig:graphicCaptionAside}}}
