Version 1.04 (see bottom for a change log list)

A few notes about this:

(1) 
The entire document is configured using configuration.tex.
Just fill out all these commands specified there.
Additionally, adapt mainfile.tex according to your purposes. 

(2)
Compilation: execute the makefile. Read Section 4.2 "Building the PDF"
of the pre-compiled for further details. (See next point!)

(3)
The subfolder "pre-compiled-PDFs" contains pre-compiled PDFs.
See the readme in that folder to check out what they are for.
(But clearly you can use them to look up how to build the PDF
in the first place! See previous point.)

(3.a)
Note that you can choose the layout of your preference (in the
above-mentioned configuration file).

(3.b)
Please, read the PDF (see above) completely!
It contains valuable advice on how to write a project report.
I advice to come back to this PDF even at later stages of the
project (i.e., after you wrote some parts already) as odds are
high you did not follow all the advice since it might not have
been relevant to you yet.
