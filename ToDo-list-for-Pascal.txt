Hey all,

First of all: this list is intended for me, Pascal (although it's public).
However, if you feel like something else should be improved, please just reach out to me! Nothing is ever perfect!

Open ToDos:
- presentation template (and possibly lectures): logo is outdated, the "l" has the wrong font (cf. report template, that's correct)
- Empirical Evaluation advice could be improved: add subsections for the various parts.
- Re-compile the entire report because the provided PDF has the wrong cover. (Make sure I have a note in the PDF telling students that they should look for different designs they can choose from.)
