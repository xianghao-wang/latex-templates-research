The files in this folder are a self-written library for the LaTeX package tikz.
tikz is an extremely fancy package for "drawing"* graphs or pictures in LaTeX.
(The current manual has already more than 1300 A4 pages!)

Anyway, so the offered library offers support for drawing plans as often used in AI Planning.
Some examples are given in the example presentation example.pdf.

I (Pascal) have been using it in my publications, further example graphics can be found in
the following publications:  (the list isn't complete, these are just a few examples)

(tikz is a recursive acronym for the sentence "tikz ist kein Zeichenprogramm",
Germam for "tikz isn't a drawing program" -- because you don't "draw", you "code".)
