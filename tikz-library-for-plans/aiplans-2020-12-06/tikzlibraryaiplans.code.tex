% 
% Please read the "IMPORTANT NOTES" after the change log that
% warns you of some pitfalls in using the library
% 

% version: 1.06 (2020-12-06)
% 
% change log:
% 
% 1.00 --> 1.01
% - added version number and history of changes
% - moved required libraries from examples in here
% - added library fit, which enables fitting nodes together (useful for methods)
% 
% 1.01 -> 1.02
% - added "raise = .25 ex," to all text decorations (in actions), such that the
%   precondition and effect texts are not directly on the lines, but a bit above them
% 
% 1.02 -> 1.03
% - added parameters to stage command: instead of displaying 'start' and 'goal', those
%   strings can now be specified
% - added feature request list
% 
% 1.03 -> 1.04
% - added commands for adding ordering constraints
% 
% 1.04 -> 1.05
% - made the variable names of the stage command consistent: now they are "init" and "goal"
%   (before they were "start" and "goal"; also okay would have been "start" and "end", but
%    this synonym has not been added)
% - added a note explaining how to use the library accordingly
%  
% 1.05 -> 1.06
% - changed the color of XXX from "cyan" to "main_color", which allows to easily change it
%   without having to manipulate this file.
% 
% feature request list:
% - the start an end goal commands (cf. 1st entry, 1.03) should be optional with standard value
% - currently, one cannot draw actions with a single precondition/effect that has no content (text)
%   (some time later: really? I thought that's possible by specifying {} within the surrounding
%   parentheses... check!)
% - there should be a standard scheme for "almost empty" actions and just 3 parameters:
%   number of precs, number of effs, and the name. Maybe also optional arguments for height and width
%   (in many cases one uses these empty boxes, so providing extra commands for them would be appreciated)
% - the name of actions cannot be specified in math mode. this needs to be changed!!
% - actions should have an optional parameter, which one can define as tikz style. 
%   example: abstract/compound = rounded corners 


% IMPORTANT NOTES: (usage)
% 
% - There is no documentation, please extract the usage from our examples; see "example.tex"
% - Note that when specifying math code ($...$) in the preconditions and effects, you need to
%   put it in an *additional* set of parentheses (in addition to the ones already there). Example:
%   pres = { {A} , {B} , {C} }, BUT:
%   pres = { {A{$_1$}} , {B{$_2$}} , {C{$_1$}} }, or simply
%   pres = { {{A$_1$}} , {{B$_2$}} , {{C$_1$}} }.
%   Otherwise, you will get strange compilation errors...
% - The same (see previous note) holds for other commands like \textbf{} -- they need to be
%   encapsulated in parentheses as well, e.g., when used as an action name.
% - If you want to use action names that use several lines (e.g., to put the 
%   parameters in different lines to save space), then use \shortstack{line-1\\...\\line-n}
