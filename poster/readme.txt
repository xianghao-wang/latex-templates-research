Let's call this version 1.00. :)
Just in case I make any changes at a later point...

A few notes about this:

- Since this is a template I use myself, and since I (working at the ANU)
  have many collaborations with others, I've inserted two logos (in this case
  from Ulm University). Clearly, only a single logo is also possible.

- Although the poster is set in landscape, you can easily set it to portrait.

- If you have any ideas how this template (including its macros) or even
  its readme can be improved, just reach out to me.
