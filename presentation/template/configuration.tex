% Note that when you create a presentatio (e.g., for a paper) you could of course provide
% one "block" for each author, which you achieve by defining both lecturers and telling
% the package (with its optional argument) that you use two authors. However, for more than
% two authors it's more canonical to use the standard one author style and just list all of
% them separated by comma. The different affiliations would then be made clear by subscripts
% Well, now however these subscripts will also appear next to the names on every single slide!
% This of course doesn't make sense, so in this case you need to define this command and copy
% the names in here again -- but without those subscripts.


% well, your affiliation!                        UPDATE!
